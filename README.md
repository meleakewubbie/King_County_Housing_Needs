## Project Proposal
This week, you need to revise your proposal based on the feedback from the TAs and the instructor. In the meantime, please conduct pilot studies in order to 1) test and/or fine-tune your proposed idea to a practical level and 2) detail specific project components. Once done, please share your revised proposal onto the discussion board. This deliverable should not be less than 300 words. Your revised proposal should have the following components.

* project idea
* project significance and broader impacts
  * please think critically, could your project generate any negative impact once done? how would you avoid that?
* primary functions and major data sources
* targeted audience
* multimedia (e.g., external links, texts, images, youtube videos, etc.)
* project format
  * Option one: Generic digital geographies project
    * map projection, map zoom levels, center.
    * description of the base map you plan to use.
    * description of the thematic layers you will make.
    * i. the used visual strategies: choropleth, proportional symbols, etc.
    * ii. the supporting data sets for each thematic map layer.
    * iii. vector or raster layer. If it is a vector, which data attribute to use? If raster, which zoom level and presumed boundingbox to use?
    * proposed interactive functions
  * Option two: Smart dashboard
    * respond to all the items listed in the option one
     How to arrange all the components on the graphical user interface (GUI)?
     What are the coordinated charts you plan to make?
     i. javascript that supports the making of a chart.
     ii. type of chart (e.g., line, bar, pie, etc.)
     iii. data attributes to be visualized.
  * Option three: Geo-narrative/Storymap
    * respond to all the items listed in the option one
    * draft the storyline
    * for each scene/action, describe the following items in detail:
      * i. the map you plan to draw
      * ii. the associated script
      * iii. the multimedia (e.g., image, video, chart, external links, etc)
    * how would you transit from one scene/action to another one? like, fly from one location to another, zoom in or zoom out?

In the meantime, you should initiate your final project by completing the following items:

create a GitHub repository
add all your team members as contributors to this final project repo
create its img and assets folder, and then upload multimedia and/or geospatial data to those folders.
start drafting the project description page onto the readme.md. You can move a lot of items from your revised proposal to the readme.md (Links to an external site.).
